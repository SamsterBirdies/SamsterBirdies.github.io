		<h2>Welcome to the first post on the website!</h2>
		<p>This is a new feature I added to the website so that I can post whatever articles I wish to. Whether this be reviews, or tutorials, just anything I want to share!
			Q: Will anyone even find this website through search results? A: Probably not. Even if they dont, its still useful to jot down my thoughts so I can share a link to people.
		</p>
		<p>In the future, I plan to add a search bar to the main post page. (www.samsterbirdies.com/post). 
		There wont be many articles for a while, so that can wait. It will take some time to figure out a long term solution for how to code the post page.
		In the meantime, I will have a simple HTML setup that I hopefully won't get stuck with forever.
		</p>
		<p>I plan to recommend and review programs (like GIMP, Audacity, Krita, Notepad++, etc. I also plan this with online resources (like freesound.org).
